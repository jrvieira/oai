You may need to parse the event data to extract each individual word and print them separately. Alternatively, you could try adjusting the buffer size or using a different buffering mode to see if that improves the output.","name":"zero","role":"assistant"},{"content":"the SEE stream is sending only one word per event. i have tried all different buffering modes to no avail","name":"zero","role":"user"},{"content":"In that case, it's possible that the issue is with the way the SSE stream is being received and processed by your program. You may want to check if there are any delays or bottlenecks in the processing of the stream that could be causing the words to be printed in chunks. Additionally, you could try using a different library or method for receiving the SSE stream to see if that improves the output.","name":"zero","role":"assistant"}]
